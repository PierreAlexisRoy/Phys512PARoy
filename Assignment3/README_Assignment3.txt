This is a read me to guide you through the numerous files
In each problem I imported the results from the wmap_camb_example.py that prof sievers wrote

-problem1.py just prints chi squared

-problem2.py computes the NewtonLM algorithm and prints the answers

-problem3_new.py runs the MCMC from question 3

-problem3_analysis.py reads the chains from problem3_new.py and makes plots for
the problem 3 (chains, fourier chains, chi2)

-problem4.py runs the MCMC for problem 4

-problem4_analysis.py reads the chains from problem4.py and studies them
it also weights the chains from #3 at the end

ALL ANSWERS AND PRINT STATEMENTS ARE FOUND IN 'answers_prints.txt'

I will copy/paste my print statements here and add some answers to questions

----------------------part 1)----------------------------

Running numerical algorithm
Converged after 9776 iterations

We see the charge density is just a circle on the edge of the wire.
Indeed, in a conductor, no charge should remain inside and it should go 
on the edge.

We get a charge per unit length of  0.00010724119433769657
Keep in mind that this does not take epsilon0 into account.

We can see on the plots that indeed, our numerical potential resembles
the theoretical one. We can also note that in both case, it is reliable 
on a circle shape since it is a radial potential. 

---------------------part 2)-----------------------------

Running numerical algorithm
Converged after 75 iterations
To obtain a precision of 0.01, we only needed 75 steps
whereas it took 9776 by the dumb method. This is a big win.

-------------------part 3)------------------------------

loop for resolution n =  100
Converged after 35 iterations

loop for resolution n =  200
Converged after 1 iterations

loop for resolution n =  300
Converged after 1 iterations

loop for resolution n =  400
Converged after 1 iterations

loop for resolution n =  500
Converged after 1 iterations

We are done! It took a total of  38  steps.

Again, using this method of combining conjugate gradient with
a changing resolution, we use roughly half the steps needed for part 2.
Although, as we get to bigger grids, the interpolation becomes slower.

-----------------part 4)--------------------------------

loop for resolution n =  100
Converged after 35 iterations

loop for resolution n =  200
Converged after 1 iterations

loop for resolution n =  300
Converged after 1 iterations

loop for resolution n =  400
Converged after 1 iterations

loop for resolution n =  500
Converged after 1 iterations

We are done!

The Efield is greater around the bump than at any place around the wire.

-----------------part 5)----------------------------------

Solving Diffusion Equation
Done!

When we solve this problem, we have to set and define a number of things:

- the size and time range
- the size of timesteps and sizesteps (grid size)- the final temperature reached by the wall
- the diffusion constant k which determines the rate of diffusion,
  in fact, choosing too big a k ends up in the solution diverging.

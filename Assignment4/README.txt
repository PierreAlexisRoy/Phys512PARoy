Phys 512 - Problem set 4 - LIGO

In this probelem set we look at ligo data and find gravitational waves
A few files come into play

The "main" file is problem1.py, in which I refer to functions defined in :

-read_ligo.py (read the strains and templates)
-noise.py (noise model and whitening function)
-wave_finder.py (analyse the data and plot the results)

So to run the code, one can just run problem1.py . 

I have put a variable 'loc' at the beginning of problem1.py and it holds the 
directory in which the data is as it was asked. 
(Note to not put the '/' at the end of this variable as it is added in the reading parts of the code).

The answers to questions, explanations and numerical results are written as the code runs in 
results.txt

The plots are stored in pdf files with rather explicit names as to what they contain.

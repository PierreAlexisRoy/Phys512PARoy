Phys 512 - Nbody Simulation
--------------------------------------------------

For this project, the program running the Nbody simulation is 
found in the file particle.py and is define as the class 'particle'. 
Comments in the code explain the features and how the code works. 

Then, for each part, a 'part{i}.py' is used to perform the different tasks asked
in the problem set. These are : 

part1.py  -- single particle
part2.-y  -- orbit with 2 particles
part3.py  -- lots of particles , periodic BC
part3b.py -- lots of particles, non periodic BC
part4.py  -- universe 


Then, in each case, the results are shown in files starting by the associated part name

- I copy/pasted the energy in txt files
- I animated a run for each part and stored it in a gif


The analysis and discussion for each part is done in Analysis.txt

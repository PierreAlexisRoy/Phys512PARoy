Here I present some analysis and discussions to the different part of the code

------------------- Part 1) ---------------------------------

This part shows a single particle in our space. Indeed, 
the energy and its position is constant in time. The particle 
remains motionless. 

------------------ Part 2) ---------------------------------

In this part, the code initializes 2 particles orbiting in the
center. We see they stay in orbit together and the energy has no clear
trend, it stays relatively constant and/or oscillates. 

------------------ Part 3) ---------------------------------

In this part, we initialize 100 000 particles randomly distributed 
on a space with periodic boundary conditions. This results in an isotropic universe. 
We see at the begining, random fluctuations create little clusters of particles, which
will in turn attract each other until it creates a big unique 'blob' of particles. 
The energy is stable up to 4 decimals and oscillates. 

----------------- Part 3b) --------------------------------

In this part, we initiate 100 000 randomly distributed particles in a space
where the boundary conditions are not periodic. Hence, there is no potential felt 
outside of the boundaries. This results in the particles clustering in small chunks, 
as well as being attracted towards the middle since no potential attracts them towards
the outside. This results in all the particles collapsing in the center of our universe. 
It is kind of like a Big Crunch. 

I also used a different softening in this part. Using a smaller softening
results in a larger number of smaller little clusters at the begining. 

Again, the energy seems rather well conserved. 

---------------- Part 4) ------------------------------------
